# hunpkg

A package manager for [Hunux GNU/Linux](https://hunuxproject.org/).

## Description

Hunpkg is a package manager built in order to manage packages for Hunux GNU/Linux. This package manager
is fully written in bash. The package building script uses the port system like in Arch's makepkg and CRUX's pkgmk, Venomlinux scratchpkg. Packages are built and installed into a temporary location using DESTDIR method and are afterwards compressed in a file
directory using tar.

Installing the packaged tar means it is extracted into real system. After that all files extracted is recorded into an index
directory. So hunpkg will track all installed files. Hunpkg can automatically resolve dependencies order. Hunpkg
reads the build script (hpkgbuild) in the ports directory in order to get all necessary variables and functions before building
them.

## hpkgbuild

`hpkgbuild` is build script sourced by `pkgbuild` to build the package.
The example of `hpkgbuild` as follows:

    # description	: This is example package
    # homepage	: https://example.com/
    # maintainer	: Emmett1, emmett1 dot 2miligrams at gmail dot com
    # depends	: package1 package2 package3

    name=foobar
    version=1.0.0
    release=1
    backup="etc/example.conf etc/foobar.conf"
    noextract="foobar.tar.xz"
    options="!strip libtool"
    source="https://dl.example.com/foobar.tar.xz
            $name-$version.tar.gz::https://github.com/achieve/$version.tar.gz
            example.conf"
    nostrip="lib.*/ld-.*\.so$
            lib.*/libc-.*\.so$
            lib.*/libpthread-.*\.so$
            lib.*/libthread_db-.*\.so$"

    build() {
        cd $name-$version

        ./configure --prefix=/usr
        make
        make DESTDIR=$PKG install

        install -d $SRC/example.conf $PKG/etc/example.conf
    }

*Note: When create new package, its recommended to build using fakeroot first to make sure the build script is not broken and leave untracked file inside system.*

#### hpkgbuild format:

* `description`: Short description for package.
* `homepage`: Url for software webpage
* `maintainer`: maintainer name and email
* `depends`: All required dependencies, separate with space.
* `name`: Package name, need same as port directory's name.
* `version`: Package's version.
* `release`: Package's release version, useful when build script need change with same package version.
* `options`: Package's build options, see 'Package options' for available options.
* `backup`: File need backup when upgrading package (without leading with '/').
* `noextract`: Specify file no need to extract, separate with space.
* `nostrip`: list file to avoid strip, can use regex
* `source`: Package's source urls, separate with space, can use as `<new-source-name>::<source-url>` to save source file with different name (see `hpkgbuild` example).

## Package options

This options is set in `/etc/hunpkg.conf` for global options:

  `OPTIONS=""`

For per package, set options in package's hpkgbuild:

  `options=""`

Add `!` in front of options to disable it, example for disable strip and remove empty directory in package (per package) as follows:

`options="!strip !emptydirs"`

Available options:

    libtool:     Keep libtool file (*.la) in packages.
    emptydirs:   Keep empty directories in packages.
    strip:       Strip symbols from binaries/libraries.
    zipman:      Compress manual (man and info) pages with gzip.
    buildflags:  Enable buildflags (CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS).
    makeflags:   Enable makeflags (MAKEFLAGS).

### pkgbuild
`pkgbuild` is a tool to build package from ports. Is will source `hpkgbuild` to get build information before creating package. Package is created into `<name>-<version>-<release>.hpkg.txz` format. To build package, you need `cd` into port directory before run `pkgbuild` command.

    Usage:
      pkgbuild [ <options> <arguments> ]

    Options:
      -i, --install             install package into system
      -u, --upgrade             upgrade package
      -r, --reinstall           reinstall package
      -c, --ignore-conflict     ignore conflict when installing package
      -v, --verbose             verbose install process
      -f, --force-rebuild       rebuild package
      -m, --skip-mdsum          skip md5sum checking
      -g, --genmdsum            generate md5sum
      -o, --download            download only source file
      -x, --extract             extract only source file
      -w, --keep-work           keep working directory
      -l, --log                 log build process
      -h, --help                show this help message
          --config=<config>     use custom config file
          --srcdir=<path>       override directory path for sources
          --pkgdir=<path>       override directory path for compiled package
          --logdir=<path>       override directory path for build logs
          --workdir=<path>      override directory path for working dir
          --no-preinstall       skip preinstall script before install package
          --no-postinstall      skip postinstall script after install package
          --no-preupgrade       skip preupgrade script before upgrade package
          --no-postupgrade      skip postupgrade script after upgrade package
          --no-backup           skip backup configuration file when upgrading package
          --redownload          re-download source file

    Example:
      pkgbuild -iw	        this will build, install package and keep working directory

    Note:
      * use pkgbuild without any options will only download source and build package by using other default options
      * pkgbuild need run inside port directory


### pkgadd
`pkgadd` is a tool to install and upgrade package created by `pkgbuild`. Install package is simply extract
`<name>-<version>-<release>.hpkg.txz` by using tar into real system then save list extracted file into package `PKGDB_DIR`.
Upgrading package is also using same extract as install, it will replace old files then compare list file from old and new
package and remove old file which not exist in new package (like Slackware pkgtool does).

    Usage:
      pkgadd package.hpkg.txz <options>

    Options:
      -u, --upgrade              upgrade package
      -r, --reinstall            reinstall package
      -c, --ignore-conflict      ignore conflict when installing package
      -v, --verbose              print files installed
      -h, --help                 show this help message
          --no-preinstall        skip preinstall script before build/install package
          --no-postinstall       skip postinstall script after install package
          --no-preupgrade        skip preupgrade script before upgrade package
          --no-postupgrade       skip postupgrade script after upgrade package
          --no-backup            skip backup when upgrading package
	  --root=<path>          install to custom root directory

    Example:
      pkgadd foobar-1.0-1.hpkg.txz -uc --no-backup       upgrade package foobar-1.0-1 without backup its
                                                         old configuration files and skip conflict check

### pkgdel
`pkgdel` is a tool to remove package from system. It will read file listed in package `PKGDB_DIR` and remove it.

    Usage:
      pkgdel [ <options> <package name> ]

    Options:
      -h, --help            show this help message
      -v, --verbose         print removed files
          --no-preremove    don't run pre-remove script
          --no-postremove   don't run post-remove script
          --root=<path>     remove package from custom root directory

    Example:
      pkgdel firefox -v --no-preremove       remove package firefox, print deleted files and skip pre-remove script

### hun
`hun` is front-end for pkgbuild, pkgadd and pkgdel. Its changed directory in ports and call pkgbuild to build package, then
pkgadd to install package into system. Its also has some extra functions like search packages, check dependency, dependent,
orphan package, duplicate ports, list installed package and etc. Run `hun help` to see available functions.

    Usage:
    hun [ mode ] [ <pkgname> <options> ]

## Extra tools
Extra tools is some scripts come with hunpkg to help users do things more easier. More extra scripts may added from time to
time.

* `vchroot`: Chroot script.
* `pkglibdepends`: Script to list package depends by shared libraries.
* `portcreate`: Script to create template port.
* `updateconf`: Script to update configuration files (*.hpkgnew).
* `revdep`: A reverse dependency script (like in Gentoo and CRUX, but my version), need to run after upgrade and remove package to check broken package(s). Specify package name if want to check single package only.

## Install script

Install scripts is a bash script contains command need to run before/after install/upgrade/remove packages in system. The suffix
of install script is `install`. This install script need to placed in port directory and later will included in tar-ed
package. The script contains the following functions which run at different times:

This script is executed using `sh`. Argument is passed when this script is executed.

### install:
    $1 : pre-install/post-install
    $2 : version

### upgrade:
    $1 : pre-upgrade/post-upgrade
    $2 : version
    $3 : old version

### remove:
    $1 : pre-remove/post-remove
    $2 : old version

Example of install script for `dbus`:

    # package install script

    action=$1
    newversion=$2
    oldversion=$3

    case $action in
            pre-install)
                    getent group messagebus >/dev/null || groupadd -g 18 messagebus
                    getent passwd messagebus >/dev/null || useradd -c "D-Bus Message Daemon User" -d /var/run/dbus -u 18 -g messagebus -s /bin/false messagebus
                    ;;
            post-install)
                    dbus-uuidgen --ensure
                    ;;
    esac

## /etc/hunpkg.repo

`/etc/hunpkg.repo` is file to define repo directory and url to sync/update port's. This is example default
`/etc/hunpkg.repo`;

    #
    # /etc/hunpkg.repo : hunpkg repo file
    #
    # format:
    #    <repo directory> <repo url for sync>
    #

	/usr/ports/core      https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hunux/ports/master/core
	/usr/ports/xorg      https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hunux/ports/master/xorg
	/usr/ports/extra     https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hunux/ports/master/extra
	/usr/ports/multilib  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hunux/ports/master/multilib
	/usr/ports/community https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hunux/ports/master/community

*Note: url is optional. Add if need to sync it.*


## Install

Installing is performed by just simply execute/running the file INSTALL.sh:

`./INSTALL.sh`

If packaging, append DESTDIR=/tmp/path in front of your command:

`DESTDIR=/tmp/path ./INSTALL.sh`
